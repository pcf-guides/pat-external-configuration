This pattern describes how to architect a centralized configuration for your application, which is external from the deployment package.

== Problem

Content does not yet exist for any patterns, but content is required to build and prove the processing and presentation of the Cosmos application.

== Solution

Create a pattern document containing fake information that stands in for real content.

== Consequences

The existence of content, whether actual or fake, will enable work to continue around pattern documents.
